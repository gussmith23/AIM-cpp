AIM-cpp
=======
Initial commit contains unedited code for AIM contained in three files (AIM.h, AIM.cpp, RunAIM.cpp).

I'm not fully sure if these are all of the appropriate files, so more files may be added later. The first time a file is added, it SHOULD be unedited from its original form.

From here on, I'll be adding comments, but I won't be changing anything substantial in the code itself.
